UNIVERSITY 

I created this repository to develop a class diagram for a University and implement a software solution for it along with test cases.

Initially, I started with creating the class diagram for the University, which gave me a basic understanding of the required components and their relationships. I created the initial class diagram which helped me to structure my thoughts and design the software solution effectively.

After finalizing the class diagram, I began coding the software solution. During the coding process, I discovered new ways to enhance the code and make it more efficient. As Java is a modular language that allows code reuse, I utilized the Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concept to develop a readable and reusable codebase.

As I progressed through the coding process, I continued to update the class diagram to ensure it aligned with the latest developments in the software solution. The final class diagram was a more refined and comprehensive version that captured all the necessary components of the software solution.

Both the initial and final class diagrams are available in the code repository, along with the software solution and test cases. This repository is a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in developing a software solution for a University using Java.
